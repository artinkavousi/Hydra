# Project TODO: r3f-water-drops

This document lists potential enhancements, features, and optimizations for the project.

## âœ¨ Features

- [ ] Add controls (GUI) for drop parameters (size, speed, frequency, color).
- [ ] Implement different drop shapes/types.
- [ ] Add interaction: create drops on mouse click/touch.
- [ ] Integrate sound effects for drops hitting the surface.
- [ ] Add a configurable surface (plane, sphere, custom model).
- [ ] Allow importing custom textures/materials for drops and surface.

## ðŸš€ Optimizations

- [ ] Implement performance monitoring (FPS, draw calls, memory).
- [ ] Optimize shaders for better performance.
- [ ] Use instancing (`InstancedMesh`) for rendering a large number of drops efficiently.
- [ ] Implement Level of Detail (LOD) for drops or environment.
- [ ] Analyze and optimize bundle size.
- [ ] Offload physics calculations to a Web Worker.

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Improve lighting setup (environment maps, dynamic lights).
- [ ] Enhance reflections and refractions on water drops and surface.
- [ ] Add post-processing effects (bloom, depth of field, screen space reflections).
- [ ] Create a more complex background/environment scene.
- [ ] Improve drop splash effect animation.

## ðŸ§¹ Code Quality & Maintenance

- [ ] Refactor components for better readability and reusability.
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests.
- [ ] Improve code comments and documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc).
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly.
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Type checking improvements (stricter TypeScript rules).

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- [ ] Enhance `README.md` with detailed setup, usage, and contribution guides.
- [ ] Add technical documentation explaining the shader logic and rendering pipeline.
